 * REFERENCE FUNCTION INTEGRATION
 * Inspired by user's find_best_bomb_position function
 * 
 * Original reference approach:
 * 1. Try bombing positions within throwing range
 * 2. For each enemy within range (distance <= 4)
 * 3. Try 3x3 area around enemy (dx=-1 to 1, dy=-1 to 1)
 * 4. Calculate total splash damage
 * 5. Choose position with best damage

/*
 * KEY DIFFERENCES FROM REFERENCE:
 * 
 * Reference Function:
 * - Simple damage calculation
 * - Basic position selection
 * - No urgency system
 * 
 * Enhanced Implementation:
 * - Urgency-based multipliers
 * - Health-based aggression
 * - Critical override system
 * - Multi-target bonuses
 * - Kill potential calculation
 * - Self-damage risk assessment
 * 
 * MAINTAINED COMPATIBILITY:
 * - Same 3x3 splash area logic
 * - Same Manhattan distance calculation  
 * - Same enemy-centered search approach
 * - Same throwing range validation (THROW_DISTANCE_MAX = 4)
 */

/*
 * INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING AI:
 * 
 * The enhanced bombing function maintains all the sophistication of the 
 * advanced AI (agent classes, tactical strategies, compound actions) while
 * incorporating the proven simple approach from the reference function.
 * 
 * This gives the best of both worlds:
 * - Reliable bombing that works (from reference)
 * - Advanced tactical intelligence (from enhanced AI)
 * - Aggressive bomb usage (new urgency system)
